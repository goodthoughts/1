<p>I overheard two EMT volunteers talking about the time they went to the aid of an elderly man. As one took down his information, the other opened his shirt to attach EKG cables.</p>
<p>“Any history of heart trouble?” asked the first volunteer.</p>
<p>“None,” said the patient.</p>
<p>Looking at the telltale scars of bypass surgery, the second volunteer wasn’t so sure. “In that case,” he said, “do you remember when the lion attacked you?”</p>
