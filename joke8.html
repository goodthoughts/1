<p>Two campers are hiking in the woods when one is bitten on the rear end by a rattlesnake. “I’ll go into town for a doctor,” the other says. He runs ten miles to a small town and finds the only doctor delivering a baby.</p>
<p>“I can’t leave,” the doctor says. “But here’s what to do. Take a knife, cut a little X where the bite is, suck out the poison and spit it on the ground.”</p>
<p>The guy runs back to his friend, who is in agony. “What did the doctor say?” the victim cries.</p>
<p>“He says you’re gonna die.”</p>
